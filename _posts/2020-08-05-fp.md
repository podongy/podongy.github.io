# * Why Functional Programming Matter?
<https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf>

* Python is not a purely functional language

* First-class functions
```python
>>> def example(a, b, **kw):
... return a*b
...
>>> type(example)
<class 'function'>
>>> example.__code__.co_varnames
('a', 'b', 'kw')
>>> example.__code__.co_argcount
2
```

* Strict and non-strict(lazy) evaluation
  - Strict evaluation: list, tuple, method definition...
  - Lazy evaluation: generator expressions, generator function, the logical expression operators and, or, and if-then-else...
  
    (A generator can only be used once in Python. See "Pitfalls")

* Recursion instead of a explicit loop state
  - Python imposes a recursion limit to detect recursive functions with improperly defined base cases
  - **Python does have a compiler to do Tail-Call Optimization (TCO)**
  > We'll often optimize a purely recursive function to use an explicit for `loop` in a generator expression.

* Writing pure functions
  - There are many internal Python objects, which are stateful. (Ex. `file` object)
  > **Always use file(or stateful) objects in a with context.**
