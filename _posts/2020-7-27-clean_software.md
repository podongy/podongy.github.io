* ###SRP(Single-Responsibility Principle) 
  - A class should have only one reason to change.
  
* ###OCP(Open-Closed Principle)
  - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
  - When a single change to a program results in a cascade of changes to dependent module 
  - “Open For Extension”
    - The behavior of the module can be extended. 
  - “Closed for Modification”.
    - The source code of such a module is inviolate. No one is allowed to make source code changes to it.
